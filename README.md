# Proyect2_3DAnimation
In this project, the aim is to transform an abstract painting animation into a three-dimensional space, infusing depth into the elements that constitute the artwork. Redefining it within a three-dimensional perspective involves giving volume to the objects, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.
The next step is to craft a brief animation. This animation will arrange the objects within the scene, preparing the artwork for viewers to navigate through the visual volume using keyboard and mouse controls.

This 3D animation project, developed within Unity for the Computer Graphics course, seeks to blend artistic abstraction with the immersive qualities of three-dimensional space, offering users an interactive exploration of visual volumes and lighting effects.

## Minimum Requirements for the Application:
1. Three-Dimensional Space Setup:
    The three-dimensional space starts empty, placing each object in its designated position. At least one object must exhibit some form of physical property, such as gravity, bouncing, or an external force. Utilize Unity's rigid bodies component for this purpose. Additionally, integrate an external 3D model (accessible in the third project), which can be in formats such as .obj, .stl, or .fbx.
2. Lighting Setup:
    The scene must encompass an infinite light source, ambient light, and two omnidirectional spotlights placed at different locations within the scene. One of the spotlights may change its position, with the ability to input new coordinates via keyboard.
3. Directional Lights/Reflectors:
    Two directional lights or reflectors should be incorporated. One aligns directly with the camera, while the other begins at the top of the scene. The second reflector can also be repositioned by inputting coordinates through the keyboard.
4. Enhanced Visual Effects:
    To accentuate diffuse reflection and specular reflection effects, most objects within the scene should exhibit a substantial degree of glossiness.
5. User Interaction and Information:
    An interactive window menu must be included to guide users regarding the necessary keys for interacting with the application. Additionally, this menu serves as the interface to capture the coordinates of light source movements.
6. Deployment:
    The project should be executable without the need to have Unity open, functioning as a standalone desktop application.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this further as needed!
